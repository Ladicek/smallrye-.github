# Welcome to SmallRye!

The SmallRye GitHub organization provides repository hosting (including build, CI, and release publishing setup) for 
Java libraries used by runtime like [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io), or application servers like 
[WildFly](https://wildfly.org/), [Open Liberty](https://openliberty.io) and [TomEE](https://tomee.apache.org). SmallRye libraries can also 
be used completely standalone in any Java application to improve the developer experience.

Feel free to browse the repository list and find something useful for your project. For additional information, please 
check our [WIKI](https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye/wiki) and [Contributing](https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye) 
guide.
